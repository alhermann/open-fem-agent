"""Arterial Network (1-D blood flow) generator for 4C.

Covers 1-D blood flow simulation in arterial networks using the reduced-order
model derived from cross-sectional averaging of the Navier-Stokes equations.
Solves for pressure, flow rate, and vessel cross-sectional area along
arterial segments connected at junctions.  Applications include pulse wave
propagation, arterial hemodynamics, and cardiovascular system modeling.
