# Open FEM Agent

An open-source **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that connects AI coding agents to 8 independent finite element codes. Any MCP-compatible AI tool (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot) can **operate** solvers, **couple** them across codes, and **develop** new solver capabilities — all through one protocol.

## Key Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FEM backends | **7 working** (FEniCSx, deal.II, 4C, NGSolve, scikit-fem, Kratos, DUNE-fem) |
| MCP tools | **11** consolidated tools |
| Physics types | **179** across all backends |
| Coupling modes | **7** (heat DD, Poisson DD, one-way TSI, two-way TSI, relaxation study, L-bracket, preCICE) |
| Supported solver pairs | **20** for domain decomposition (any Python solver + any backend) |
| Tests | **97 passed** |
| E2E stress tests | **20 completed** (19 pass + 1 partial) |

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd open-fem-agent
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Install solver backends (pick what you need)

```bash
# pip-installable (any combination)
pip install ngsolve scikit-fem dune-fem
pip install KratosMultiphysics KratosStructuralMechanicsApplication

# FEniCSx (requires conda)
conda create -n fenics -c conda-forge fenics-dolfinx
# or: pip install fenics-dolfinx (if available for your platform)

# deal.II (system package)
sudo apt install libdeal.ii-dev   # Ubuntu/Debian

# 4C Multiphysics (build from source — see 4C documentation)
```

### 3. Configure the MCP server

Copy the example settings and fill in your paths:

```bash
cp .claude/settings.json.example .claude/settings.json
# Edit .claude/settings.json — set paths for your installed solvers
```

For **Claude Code**, the settings are auto-loaded from `.claude/settings.json`.
For **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, or **Copilot**, configure the MCP server in your tool's settings pointing to `.venv/bin/python -m server` in the `src/` directory.

### 4. Verify

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
cd src && python -m server  # should start without errors

# Run tests
cd .. && pytest tests/ -v
```

## Environment Variables

Solver backends are auto-detected from pip/conda installations. For compiled solvers or source-level development access, set these in your MCP settings:

| Variable | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `FOURC_ROOT` | 4C source tree | `/home/user/4C` |
| `FOURC_BINARY` | 4C binary path | `/home/user/4C/build/4C` |
| `DEALII_ROOT` | deal.II source | `/opt/dealii` |
| `FENICS_ROOT` | FEniCSx source | `/home/user/dolfinx` |
| `NGSOLVE_ROOT` | NGSolve source | `/home/user/ngsolve` |
| `KRATOS_ROOT` | Kratos source | `/home/user/Kratos` |
| `DUNE_ROOT` | DUNE-fem source | `/home/user/dune-fem` |
| `SKFEM_ROOT` | scikit-fem source | `/home/user/scikit-fem` |

When a `*_ROOT` variable is set, the agent can browse, modify, and rebuild the solver source code (developer mode).

## Three Modes of Operation

### 1. Operate: Run Simulations
The agent generates solver-specific input, runs the simulation, and validates results.

### 2. Couple: Multi-Solver Workflows
Domain decomposition, field transfer, and multi-physics coupling across different FEM codes.

### 3. Develop: Extend Solver Capabilities
When a solver lacks a needed feature, the agent can read source code, implement the missing piece, rebuild, and test.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions that improve the **general-purpose** capabilities of the Open FEM Agent. The key principle:

**Every improvement must benefit ALL simulations, not be fine-tuned for specific examples.**

### How to contribute

1. **Report agent behavior** — Run any of the benchmark prompts (or your own) with your AI tool and solver setup. Report:
   - Which AI tool you used (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
   - The exact prompt you gave
   - What worked and what didn't
   - The agent's retrospective (ask the debrief questions below)

2. **Improve solver knowledge** — Add pitfalls, element catalogs, or API documentation that would help any agent set up simulations correctly. Focus on things the agent had to discover by trial-and-error.

3. **Add solver backends** — Implement the `SolverBackend` interface for a new FEM code.

4. **Expand coupling** — Add script generators for new solver pairs in `src/tools/coupling.py`.

### What NOT to contribute

- Benchmark-specific parameter databases (the agent should research these per-problem)
- Model-specific templates (e.g., "Turek-Hron FSI2 template") — these are fine-tuning
- Hardcoded paths or machine-specific configurations

### Debrief questions (ask after every stress test)

```
- "What went wrong and what workarounds did you have to use?"
- "Which MCP tools were useful and which were missing or unhelpful?"
- "What information did you have to look up online that should have been available through the MCP?"
- "What parameters did you struggle with and why?"
- "If you had to do this again, what would you do differently?"
```

Feed the answers back as general-purpose improvements to the MCP knowledge and tools.
