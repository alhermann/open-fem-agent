"""Multiscale (FE-squared) generator for 4C.

Covers computational homogenisation using nested FE simulations (FE^2).
A macroscopic structural problem is solved with standard finite elements,
but the constitutive response at each Gauss point is computed by solving
a microscale boundary value problem (Representative Volume Element, RVE)
instead of using a closed-form material law.  This enables capturing
complex microstructural effects (heterogeneity, damage, plasticity) at
the macroscale without explicit homogenisation assumptions.
