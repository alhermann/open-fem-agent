"""Reduced-Dimensional Airways generator for 4C.

Covers 1-D reduced-dimensional modeling of the pulmonary airway tree.
The airways are represented as a branching network of 1-D elements
where each element models a compliant tube segment with airflow governed
by pressure-flow relationships derived from the Navier-Stokes equations
under the long-wavelength approximation.  Applications include
respiratory mechanics, ventilator design, and patient-specific lung
modeling.
