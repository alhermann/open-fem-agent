# Open FEM Agent — Stress Tests

These tests verify the agent's ability to set up, run, and validate simulations across all backends. Each test exposes different capabilities and potential gaps. Findings from each test should be used to improve the **general-purpose** infrastructure — not to fine-tune for specific examples.

## How to Use These Tests

1. Run each prompt in a **fresh interactive Claude terminal** (`cd /home/alexander/Schreibtisch/open-fem-agent && claude`)
2. Let the agent work through the sub-agent workflow (research → setup → critic → execution)
3. Note what works and what fails
4. After the test completes, ask the agent these debrief questions:
   - "What went wrong and what workarounds did you have to use?"
   - "Which MCP tools were useful and which were missing or unhelpful?"
   - "What information did you have to look up online that should have been available through the MCP?"
   - "What parameters did you struggle with and why?"
   - "If you had to do this again, what would you do differently?"
5. Feed the debrief answers back to the development agent for general-purpose improvements
6. Never fine-tune for the specific test case — fix the underlying infrastructure issue
7. After fixing, re-run the same test to verify the fix works
8. Purge conversation history between tests: `./clear_history.sh`
