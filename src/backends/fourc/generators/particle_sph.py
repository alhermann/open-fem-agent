"""Generator for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations in 4C.

SPH is a meshfree Lagrangian method primarily used for fluid dynamics
(dam breaks, sloshing, free-surface flows) but also applicable to
solid-mechanics problems.  In 4C it shares the particle infrastructure
with peridynamics (PD) but uses fundamentally different physics:
kernel-weighted summation/integration for field quantities rather than
pairwise bond forces.
