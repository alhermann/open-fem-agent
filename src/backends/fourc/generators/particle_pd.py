"""Generator for Peridynamics (bond-based PD) simulations in 4C.

Encodes general PD knowledge including pre-cracks, rigid impactors
via boundaryphase, SPH infrastructure requirements, and CFL calculation.

Key insight: PD in 4C rides on top of the SPH particle framework.  Even
though the physics is peridynamic (bond-based), the SPH kernel, boundary
formulation, and transport velocity parameters *must* be specified or the
code crashes with ``pd_neighbor_pairs = 0``.
